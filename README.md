# Neighborhood Effects of Trade in Landlocked Countries

The dataset was part of my undergraduate senior project. The dataset contains data for 30 landlocked coutries over five years from 2014 to 2018. The data was obtained from the World Bank's World Development Indicators database and its World Inegrated Trade Services database. The goal of the project was to look at the effects of trade with neighboring countries on the economic level of a landlocked country.
